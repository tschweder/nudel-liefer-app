# Dedicated end-to-end database (NUD-162)

Some Playwright specs own a day of the database they read, and one of them needs the demo data. Run
against the developer's database, they abort with "Precondition failed" as soon as it holds a tour
for today, and `tour-split.spec.ts` used to fail on "0 tour tabs" without saying why. This page
describes the supported way to run them: **a database of its own, prepared by one command**.

Nothing here deletes, migrates or even opens your development or production database. The command
refuses to run when `E2E_DATABASE_URL` names the same host/port/database as `DATABASE_URL` (or as
`DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`, `BACKUP_DATABASE_URL`, `RESTORE_DATABASE_URL`,
`PARKING_IMPORT_DATABASE_URL`).

## 1. What the specs need

| Spec             | Needs                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mvp-happy-path` | demo seed: confirmed depot pin, demo drivers, catalog products; **no tour for today** |
| `late-orders`    | base seed: admin + `NUDELN-BEUTEL` / `NUDELN-KARTON`; **no tour for today**           |
| `tour-split`     | base seed: admin + `NUDELN-KARTON`; **no tour on the day it plans**                   |
| everything else  | base seed; most specs create and delete their own rows                                |

The checks run before the first browser step and print what is missing, which database it is
(`host:port/name`, never the password) and the command that fixes it.

## 2. One-time setup

1. Create an empty PostgreSQL database next to the dev one, e.g. on the local Docker/embedded
   Postgres (`docker-compose.yml`, port 5123):

   ```bash
   createdb -h localhost -p 5123 -U postgres nudel_e2e     # or: docker exec -it <pg> createdb -U postgres nudel_e2e
   ```

   Any name and server works, including a throwaway Neon branch — it must only be a database of its
   own.

2. Put the URL in `.env` (git-ignored) next to `DATABASE_URL`:

   ```dotenv
   E2E_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5123/nudel_e2e
   ```

   `playwright.config.ts` and `pnpm e2e:db:reset` read it from there (or from the shell). Without the
   variable nothing changes: the suite keeps using `DATABASE_URL`, exactly as before NUD-162.

3. Prepare the database:

   ```bash
   pnpm e2e:db:reset
   ```

## 3. `pnpm e2e:db:reset`

One command, and it only ever touches `E2E_DATABASE_URL`:

1. prints the target as `host:port/name` and refuses to continue if it is a protected database;
2. `prisma migrate reset --force` — drops everything in that database and applies every migration
   (the base seed configured in `prisma.config.ts` runs as part of it);
3. runs the base seed and `seedDemo({ photos: false })` — admin, Settings with a **confirmed depot
   pin**, demo drivers (`fahrer-de`, `driver-hans`, `driver-en`, `driver-sr`, `driver-cs`,
   `driver-new`), catalog products, vehicles, 20 demo customers and their confirmed orders **for the
   next delivery day**. Today stays free of orders, so no tour exists for it;
4. prints the seed summary and the reminder to run the suite with the variable still set.

It needs `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (from `.env`, default `change-me-local-only`) and no S3/MinIO, because
the demo photos are skipped. It never touches the object storage.

Run it again whenever a spec complains about a tour for today or about missing seed data: it always
produces the same clean starting point. It takes well under a minute on a local Postgres.

## 4. Running the suite

```bash
pnpm test:e2e tests/e2e/late-orders.spec.ts tests/e2e/mvp-happy-path.spec.ts tests/e2e/tour-split.spec.ts
```

`playwright.config.ts` copies `E2E_DATABASE_URL` into `DATABASE_URL` in the Playwright process (the
specs open their own `pg` connections) and passes it to the webServer command, so app and assertions
read the same rows. `reuseExistingServer: !CI` and the `E2E_PREBUILT` switch are unchanged, see
[`env.md`](./env.md).

Two caveats:

- **A reused server keeps its own database.** Locally (`without CI`) Playwright reuses a server that
  already listens on the port; that process was started with its own environment, so it still talks
  to `DATABASE_URL`. Stop a `pnpm dev` on the port first, or run with `CI=1` (fresh server, but then
  use a free `PORT=` and expect the build time, see `E2E_PREBUILT`).
- **The specs without the "today" requirement are indifferent.** They work on either database; run
  them with or without `E2E_DATABASE_URL`.

## 5. Reading the messages

| Message starts with                                              | Cause                                                 | Fix                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Precondition failed: … has not applied N migration(s)`          | the database is behind `prisma/migrations`            | `pnpm db:migrate` (or `pnpm e2e:db:reset`)                 |
| `Precondition failed: … is not seeded — missing …`               | no base seed                                          | `pnpm db:seed` (or `pnpm e2e:db:reset`)                    |
| `Precondition failed: the depot pin is not confirmed …`          | no demo seed                                          | `pnpm db:seed --demo --no-photos` (or `pnpm e2e:db:reset`) |
| `Precondition failed: … tour already exists for today …`         | another spec or a manual run created a tour for today | `pnpm e2e:db:reset`                                        |
| `E2E_DATABASE_URL is not set …`                                  | the variable is missing                               | section 2 above                                            |
| `E2E_DATABASE_URL points at the same database as DATABASE_URL …` | the e2e variable was pointed at the dev database      | use a database of its own                                  |

## 6. Cleaning up

The database is disposable: drop it when you no longer need it
(`dropdb -h localhost -p 5123 -U postgres nudel_e2e`) and remove `E2E_DATABASE_URL` from `.env`. The
suite falls back to `DATABASE_URL` again.

## 7. CI

The CI workflow keeps its own database per job (it migrates and seeds it in the job), so
`E2E_DATABASE_URL` is optional there; setting it to that job's database is harmless and makes the
"same database" guard cover it.
